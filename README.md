My annual try to solve the Advent of Code puzzles - 2022 edition.

(Yes it's Spring 3 and Java 17!)

[Link to the AOC 2022 page](https://adventofcode.com/2022/)

I solved everything up to day 15 with two stars and day 17 with one star.

The remaining puzzles I didn't approach as they became more a maths problem than a coding challenge.
Yes I mean you Day 11,15,17 second star! * angryface *

## Disclaimer
You may use this code as you want. If you can learn something from it, great, please let me know.
It's not intended to be the best possible approach to the problems. Some problems I deliberately 
approached with a certain restriction in my head (e.g. "I will do this with OOP", "I will use stream
as much as possible").
